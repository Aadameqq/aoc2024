# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This repository includes my solutions for the daily coding challenges presented during Advent of Code 2024. 
I wrote all solutions in **C#** as part of my journey to learn and improve my skills in the language. 
Over the course of the event, I successfully earned **29 stars**.

## Structure

Each day has its own project containing:
1. My solution in C#.
2. Input.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aadameqq/aoc2024.git
```

Run the solution for a specific day, use the following command:
```bash
